Assignment #1 - COMP345 - Section DI - Fall 2015
Author: Jennifer Sunahara (27590628)

This is the README.txt file to accompany the submission.
This assignment is a demo of Part1: Map.
This assignment was made with the Visual Studio 2015 (Community version) environment.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


Included are the following files:

Header files (3):
Country.h
Continent.h
Map.h

Implementation files (4):
Country.cpp
Continent.cpp
Map.cpp
Driver.cpp

Non-programming-related files (1):
Assign01.pdf
README.txt


I have only included the .cpp and .h files, as opposed to the entire solution as I was concerned
that different versions of Visual Studio may misbehave.

Instructions:
Please open a new empty project of type Win32 Console Application.
Add implementation files to the Source files folder.
Add header files to the Header files folder.
Build the solution and run.
